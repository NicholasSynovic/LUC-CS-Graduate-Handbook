Graduate School Offices
=======================

The main office of the Graduate School is on the fourth floor of the Granada Center on the Lake Shore Campus. This office handles admissions and financial awards, and houses the permanent files of all students throughout their graduate careers.

We strongly recommend that you contact the department faculty and staff first unless your matter absolutely requires direct Graduate School assistance. Going to Graduate School first is more likely to slow things down for you than speed them up.
